    Knowing vs Doing: Why Lifestyle Diseases Still Rise in India
  </h1>
  <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-6">Posted on Sep 11, 2025 by Vandna Joshi</p>
  
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    We live in a time where information about health is everywhere. Most people already know that poor lifestyle choices—like eating too much junk food, sitting for long hours, or ignoring exercise—can lead to serious conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, and fatty liver disease. Similarly, everyone knows that pollution is dangerous—whether air, water, land, or noise pollution—yet little changes in our daily behavior.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-6 mb-3">The Global Picture: What WHO Data Shows</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
    <li>Healthy life expectancy (HALE) rose by 5.4 years (2000–2019) but dropped by 1.5 years during COVID-19.</li>
    <li>NCDs like diabetes, heart disease, and cancers are the leading killers—2030 targets are off-track.</li>
    <li>Diabetes, obesity, and fatty liver are sharply increasing worldwide.</li>
    <li>Pollution (air, water, soil, noise) and malnutrition remain top global health risks.</li>
    <li>India: deaths from cancer, diabetes, and heart disease are rising even as they fall globally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-6 mb-3">The Gap Between Knowing and Doing</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Eating fried food or skipping workouts feels good in the short term, but the damage builds up silently. In India, cultural food habits, lack of safe walking spaces, and the “not me, not now” mindset keep people from acting on what they already know.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-6 mb-3">The Growing Threat of Fatty Liver Disease</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Fatty liver is one of India’s fastest-growing lifestyle disorders, often linked to diabetes and obesity. It is silent in the beginning but can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer if unchecked.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-6 mb-3">Pollution: A Hidden Driver of Lifestyle Disease</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
    <li><b>Air:</b> asthma, COPD, cancers, heart disease.</li>
    <li><b>Water:</b> diarrhea, hepatitis, parasitic infections.</li>
    <li><b>Soil:</b> pesticides, heavy metals in food.</li>
    <li><b>Noise:</b> stress, hypertension, heart disease.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-6 mb-3">What Can We Do Differently?</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
    <li>Start small: walk 15 min, replace one fried meal, hydrate properly.</li>
    <li>Community: yoga/walking groups, healthy food drives.</li>
    <li>Technology: step counters, diet apps, pollution trackers.</li>
    <li>Policy: stronger pollution control, affordable healthy food, better healthcare access.</li>
    <li>Peer support: families/friends supporting each other’s health goals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mt-6 mb-3">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    WHO data shows the world is off-track to meet health goals by 2030. In India, lifestyle diseases like fatty liver, diabetes, and hypertension are rising sharply. We don’t lack knowledge—we lack consistent action. True change starts with small daily habits at home, in schools, and in communities.
